2. how to send notification mail content - related (change ezcomnotificationmanager)

1. Try to make the unit test data xmlized, instead of putting all the test data into test code. 
2. In ezcomNotificationManager, if we should use __get and __set for property.
3. The static in PHP is per request, I'm a little worried about the performance and doubt that how much the singleton can improve.
4. support cookie
5. make language as separate field in subscription table
5. permission
6. change the ezcomCookieManager into singleton

1.put cache-block into comment list, add form.
2.install sql script when enabling the extension
3.structurize the view.php edit.php,etc to make it more readable
4.question: should I check permission and content status in add.php ?
5.delete permission checking in delete.php and delete.tpl
6.issue: if the user can only view one language(A)'s comment, when viewing the comments in A, if the user click another language(B), then click the content, the user can't see.

1. create interfaces to support further extension.
possible extensions:
   - add fields
        - the adding should can  be extendable in
            - view fetch, view template
            - adding(before adding), validating
            - update fetch, update template, update(before updating)
   - delete/hide fields
   - add limitations
   - 

2. when adding/edit/deleting the comment, check if the commenting is enabled and comments are visible
3. clean up WebsiteURLBase in ezcomments.ini
4. the email doesn't have 'to' 
5. support '+' in ajax mode (This is json's problem, which replace + with space)
