2. how to send notification mail content - related (change ezcomnotificationmanager)

1. Try to make the unit test data xmlized, instead of putting all the test data into test code. 
2. In ezcomNotificationManager, if we should use __get and __set for property.
3. The static in PHP is per request, I'm a little worried about the performance and doubt that how much the singleton can improve.
4. support cookie
5. make language as separate field in subscription table
5. permission
6. change the ezcomCookieManager into singleton
