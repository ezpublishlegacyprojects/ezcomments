2. how to send notification mail content - related (change ezcomnotificationmanager)

1. Try to make the unit test data xmlized, instead of putting all the test data into test code. 
2. In ezcomNotificationManager, if we should use __get and __set for property.
3. The static in PHP is per request, I'm a little worried about the performance and doubt that how much the singleton can improve.
