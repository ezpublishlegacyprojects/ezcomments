FAQ

1. Can eZ Comments be installed on eZ Publish 4.2?
The recommended eZ Publish version of eZ Comments is at least 4.3. But it's possible to be installed it on early version, with an issue.
If eZ Comments is installed on eZ Publish before 4.3, when a user is granted permission to edit or delete his own comment, he will be able to see all the edit and delete buttons on the comment list, even if he can not edit or delete all the comments after clicking the button. If you don't have this permission setting or if you think that's acceptable, eZ Comments will work fine.

2. Why can't I find the comment setting link in my profile page?
Check site.ini, make sure ActiveExtensions[]=ezcomments is before ActiveExtensions[]=ezwebin. Then the comment setting link will be shown in my profile page.

3. Why do I get this message 'The following information is either missing or invalid: * attribute 'comment': Comments (358)'?
That's because there are more than 2 comment attributes in the class. eZ Comments doesn't support more than 2 comment attributes in one class currently. If you delete one comment attribute, it will work.
